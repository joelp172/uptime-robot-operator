# uptime-robot-operator Project

Kubernetes operator for managing UptimeRobot monitors via CRDs.

## Tech Stack

- Go 1.23+
- Kubebuilder v4
- controller-runtime
- Ginkgo/Gomega for testing

## Key Directories

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `api/v1alpha1/` | CRD type definitions |
| `internal/controller/` | Reconciliation logic |
| `internal/uptimerobot/` | UptimeRobot API client |
| `config/` | Kustomize manifests |
| `test/e2e/` | End-to-end tests |

## CRDs

- `Account` - UptimeRobot API credentials (cluster-scoped)
- `Contact` - Alert contact reference (cluster-scoped)
- `Monitor` - Monitor configuration (namespaced)

## Common Tasks

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Generate CRDs | `make manifests` |
| Generate code | `make generate` |
| Format code | `make fmt` |
| Run locally | `make run` |
| Build image | `make docker-build IMG=name:tag` |

## Dependencies

This operator does NOT require:
- cert-manager
- prometheus-operator

It only needs a Kubernetes cluster with the CRDs installed.
